# Machine Learning Prediction Web Application

## ðŸš€ Project Overview

This project is a dynamic **Flask web application** designed to provide real-time machine learning predictions using a custom pipeline. It serves as a practical demonstration of deploying machine learning models in a production environment while highlighting essential skills in software development, cloud deployment, and data science.

## ðŸŒŸ Key Features

- **User-Centric Interface**: An intuitive web interface that allows users to input data and receive instant predictions, enhancing user experience and engagement.
- **Custom Machine Learning Pipeline**: Implements a robust and scalable pipeline that includes data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model inference to deliver accurate predictions.
- **Containerization with Docker**: The entire application is containerized, ensuring consistency across development and production environments and simplifying deployment.
- **Seamless Azure Integration**: Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) setup with GitHub Actions to automate testing and deployment to Azure Container Registry (ACR).

## ðŸ›  Technologies Used

- **Programming Language**: Python 3.8
- **Web Framework**: Flask
- **Containerization**: Docker
- **Cloud Services**: Azure, Azure Container Registry
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions
- **Machine Learning**: Custom pipeline built with relevant ML libraries (e.g., scikit-learn, pandas)

## ðŸ’¡ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before running the application, ensure you have the following:

- Docker installed on your machine.
- An Azure account with access to Azure Container Registry.
- Python 3.8 or higher for local development.

### Installation Steps

1. **Clone the repository**:
```
git clone https://github.com/omaar25/Predictive-Maintenance-Web-Application.git
cd Predictive-Maintenance-Web-Application
```

2. **Build the Docker image**:

```
docker build -t ml-predictor-app .
```

3. **Run the Docker container**:

```
docker run -d -p 8080:8080 ml-predictor-app
```
4. **Access the application**:
Open your browser and navigate to 
```
http://localhost:8080
```

## How It Works
1. Data Input: Users can input data via the web interface.
2. Prediction Display: When data is submitted, the application processes the input through the custom pipeline to display prediction instantly.

## Continuous Integration and Deployment
Automated workflows using GitHub Actions ensure that every push to the main branch triggers a build and deployment pipeline, enhancing code quality and deployment efficiency.
The application is pulled from Azure Container Registry and runs seamlessly in any environment.
